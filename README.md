## Description
This is a project that utilizes two different APIs in a way to streamline information. Have you ever wanted to be able to see videos and Wikipedia searches in one page? With our website, you can. It has a very simple UI that is easy to navigate. The left will hold the search input, allowing you to search anything you want. The middle has the Wikipedia page links, and the right has Bing videos. Refreshing the page will not lose your place, and your searches will stay until you search something new.

## Usage

This website should be viewed in a webpage browser.  If inside Google Chrome, dev tools will allow for further code inspections.
